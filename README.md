# Black Jack Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Black Jack game implemented in Python! This repository contains a simple yet engaging text-based Black Jack game where you can test your luck against a computerized dealer. The game follows standard Black Jack rules, providing a classic and entertaining experience.

## How to Play

### Setting Up the Game
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game code.
3. Run the Python script (`blackjack.py`).

### Game Features
- **Player Name:** Enter your name to personalize the gaming experience.
- **Bankroll Management:** Start with a bank of $1000 and use strategic bets to maximize your winnings.
- **Automatic Deck Shuffling:** The game shuffles the deck after 100 rounds to keep things interesting.
- **Intuitive Commands:** Use simple commands (`h` for Hit, `s` for Stand, `d` for Double Down) to make your moves.

## Rules and Gameplay
- The game uses a standard deck of cards with 5 decks shuffled together.
- Aces automatically adjust their value to optimize your hand.
- The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.
- Enjoy various actions like hitting for additional cards, standing to keep your hand, and doubling down for increased bets.

## Winning and Losing
- If your hand value exceeds 21, you bust and lose the round.
- If the dealer busts, you win the round.
- The player with the hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.
- Ties (push) occur if you and the dealer have the same hand value.

## Notes for Developers
- The game is implemented in Python, utilizing object-oriented programming principles.
- Explore and modify the code to add new features, enhance gameplay, or fix any bugs.

## Future Improvements
Feel free to contribute to the project! Here are some ideas for future improvements:
- Implement a "split" move to allow players to split their hand into two separate hands.
- Add more sophisticated betting strategies.
- Enhance the user interface for a more engaging experience.

Enjoy playing Black Jack, and may the cards be in your favor!
